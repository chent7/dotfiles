#### Directions:
- Packages from arch listed in `.installed-packages`
- Packages from pip listed in `.installed-pip`
- Information on osu! see `~/Games/osu!/.osu-wine/readme.txt`
#### Note:
- My dotfiles are designed for `lightdm` and won't work properly with `xinit` display managers like `emptty`
- I use proprietary `nvidia-dkms` drivers
- Window manager is `qtile`
- Shell is `zsh`
- `fcitx5` for input
